# Basic C# Projects


This repository contains the small projects that I produced while learning C# at The Tech Academy

I created the [Car Insurance Project](https://github.com/CarterT101/BasicCSharpProjects/tree/main/CarInsurance) that is an MVC web application that takes user's input on their information and calculates a quote based on business logic and display it on the created admin page.
